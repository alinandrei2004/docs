## Unikraft's Testing Framework

Unikraft's testing framework, [`uktest`](https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft/tree/staging/lib/uktest), has been inspired by KUnit and provides a flexible testing API.

### API Overview

To use the API you have to include `uk/test.h`.
To register a testsuite, we simply call `uk_testsuite_register`.

```C++
uk_testsuite_register(factorial_testsuite, NULL);
```

We use the macro `UK_TESTCASE` to both declare a test suite and add a test case to it:

```C++
UK_TESTCASE(testsuite_name, testcase1_name)
{
        UK_TEST_EXPECT_SNUM_EQ(some_function(2), 2);
}

UK_TESTCASE(testsuite_name, testcase2_name)
{
        UK_TEST_EXPECT_SNUM_EQ(some_other_function(2), 2);
}
```

### The Design behind Unikraft's Testing Framework

The key ideas that were followed when writing `uktest` are:

* **Non-sophisticated**:
It should follow an existing framework (e.g. [`KUnit`](https://kunit.dev/) in order to reuse the existing documentation and have a smaller learning curve
* Ability to specify when to run the tests during the boot process
* Written in C
* Should not conflict with other unit test frameworks (e.g. the one used for testing libraries and apps such as [`Google Test`](https://github.com/google/googletest))
* BSD-compatible license
* Have the ability to write tests as a whole file or as in-line tests above a method

### How Tests Are Run

Unikraft boot process is centred around the idea of constructors.
Not to be confused with class constructors, Unikraft's constructors are simply functions registered in a special section inside the image and ran at boot time.
We use the `section` [`attribute`](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-3.2/gcc/Variable-Attributes.html) from GCC to tell the compiler to a specific section inside the binary, in our case `.uk_ctortab`.
Later at boot, we go through each value stored in the section and run it:

```C++
uk_ctortab_foreach(ctorfn, __init_array_start, __init_array_end) {
        if (!*ctorfn)
                continue;

        uk_pr_debug("Call constructor: %p()...\n", *ctorfn);
                (*ctorfn)();
}
```

There are multiple such loops through the boot code found in [`ukboot/boot.c`](https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft/blob/staging/lib/ukboot/boot.c).
The testing framework simply registers the test function that needs to be called during the run.

### Key Functions and Data Structures

The key structure used is `uk_testcase` defined as:

```C++
struct uk_testcase {
        /* The name of the test case. */
        const char *name;
        /* Pointer to the method  */
        void (*func)(struct uk_testcase *self);
        /* The number of failed assertions in this case. */
        unsigned int failed_asserts;
        /* The number of assertions in this case. */
        unsigned int total_asserts;
};
```

The macro that we're using to check conditions is `UK_TEST_ASSERT`.
It is a wrapper over `_uk_test_do_assert`:

```C++
static inline void
_uk_test_do_assert(struct uk_testcase *esac, bool cond, const char *fmt, ...)
{
        ...
        esac->total_asserts++;

        if (!cond) {
                esac->failed_asserts++;
        ...
        }
}
```

Basically, what the function does is to increment the number of failed asserts if the condition is false.

We've seen that `uk_testsuite_register` is used to register tests.
What this call boils down to is:

```C++
#define uk_test_at_initcall_prio(suite, class, prio)                   \
        static int UK_TESTSUITE_FN(suite)(void)                        \
        {                                                              \
                uk_testsuite_add(&suite);                              \
                uk_testsuite_run(&suite);                              \
                return 0;                                              \
        }                                                              \
        uk_initcall_class_prio(UK_TESTSUITE_FN(suite), class, prio)
```

We can see that `uk_initcall_class_prio` registers the newly defined function as a constructor to be called at a specific time during the boot process.
`uk_testsuite_add` simply adds the test suite to a linked listed of available test suites.
`uk_testsuite_run` simply iterates runs all the test cases in the test suite.

```C++
int uk_testsuite_run(struct uk_testsuite *suite)
{
        ...
        /* Iterate through all the registered test cases */
        uk_testsuite_for_each_case(suite, testcase) {

        /* Run the test case function testcase->func(testcase);

                /* If one case fails, the whole suite fails. */
                if (testcase->failed_asserts > 0)
                        suite->failed_cases++;
        }
        ...
}
```
