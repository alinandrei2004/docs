In the world of modern software development, it's crucial to stay ahead of the curve and embrace cutting-edge technologies.
Unikernels, which are specialized, single-address-space machine images that run a single application, have been gaining traction as a powerful approach to building lightweight, secure, and highly efficient software systems.

Unikraft, an open-source project for building unikernels, has been at the forefront of this movement.
It offers developers a versatile and efficient framework to create unikernels for various use cases.
And today, we're thrilled to introduce KraftKit v0.7.0, a huge update to the companion command-line tool that makes Unikraft even more accessible and developer-friendly!

</Info>

With a whole slew of new features and improvements, KraftKit v0.7.0 is a game-changer for unikernel development.

The highlights of this KraftKit release:

* Adds support for building via Dockerfiles: the building power of Docker meets the deployment power of unikernels!
* Powers up a [catalog of application and languages](https://github.com/unikraft/catalog), to significantly simplify build/run workflows.
* Introduces a new Kraftfile with clear, simple to use syntax for specifying builds.
* Introduction of the `kraft cloud` command, for deployments via [KraftCloud](https://kraft.cloud).

Let's dive into the exciting new features and improvements in this release:


## `Kraftfile` v0.6 Specification Update

This release introduces a new `Kraftfile` specification which makes new adjustments to the user's workflow such that it is easier to run applications in binary compatibility mode and with a template.
At a high-level, the following adjustments are made to the specification:

- A new top-level `runtime` element to be used for defining the user of an elfloader or existing pre-built unikernel image.
  Similar to other component-type elements like `unikraft` and `libraries`, the `runtime` element is intended to allow for a short-hand and long-hand syntax where a `source`, `version` and set of `kconfig` options can be used to qualify the elfloader application.
- Abbreviations of the `specification`, `architecture` and `platform` element names such that can be used in short-hand syntax as `spec`, `arch` and `plat`, respectively.
- Top-level `volumes` element which is used for defining user-specified paths which are to be used during runtime of a unikernel.
- Top-level `rootfs` element which is used for defining the root filesystem of the user.
  The provided implementation allows a user to serialize a filesystem from three new contexts: an existing CPIO archive (pass-through), a path to a directory, and a `Dockerfile` which is constructed via [BuildKit](https://github.com/moby/buildkit).
- Top-level `cmd` which is a string or list which represents the command-line argument to execute for the unikernel as a way to porcelain the Kraftfile and the intended application use case.

Aside from these introductions to the v0.6 specification, the underlying parser is adjusted to handle reading both the specifications and defaulting to v0.6 as the latest.
These adjustments are subsequently implemented through the release.


### High-level `Kraftfile` v0.6 specification changes

#### A. Introduction of short-hand syntaxes

1. In addition to bumping the specification version to v0.6, the `specification` element can be abbreviated to `spec`:

   ```yaml
   spec: v0.6
   ```

2. Within the list of `targets`, the `architecture` and `platform` attributes can be abbreviated to `arch` and `plat`, respectively, and be used interchangeably:

   ```yaml
   targets:
   - plat: qemu
     arch: x86_64
   ```

   ```yaml
   targets:
   - plat: qemu
     architecture: x86_64
   ```

   ```yaml
   targets:
   - platform: qemu
     arch: x86_64
   ```

3. The list of targets can now accept an even shorter syntax where only the architecture and platform are desired in the list:

   ```yaml
   targets:
   - qemu/x86_64
   ```

   This shorthand syntax can be mixed with full target elements:

   ```yaml
   targets:
   - qemu/x86_64
   - platform: qemu
     architecture: arm64
   - plat: fc
     arch: x86_64
   ```

#### C. Introduction of a `cmd` element for specifying program operation

The `cmd` is array or string element which can be used for setting default arguments to be used during the instantiation of a new unikernel instance:

1. Specified as an in-line array:

   ```yaml
   spec: v0.6

   cmd: ["-c", "/nginx/conf/nginx.conf"]
   ```

1. Specified as a multi-line array:

   ```yaml
   spec: v0.6

   cmd:
   - -c
   - /nginx/conf/nginx.conf
   ```

1. Specified as a string:

   ```yaml
   spec: v0.6

   cmd: "-c /nginx/conf/nginx.conf"
   ```

#### C. Introduction to `runtime` element for accessing pre-built images

The `runtime` element is a new top-level element which has been designed to ease the declaration of a previously constructed unikernel image in the project.
In many cases, specifically instances where the user is writing in a high-level language such as Python or where they wish to use a pre-built Linux userpace image, the user does not care for wanting to build a unikernel image from scratch.
Instead, the goal is to leverage pre-built unikernel images which are distributed using the [OCI Package Manager](https://github.com/unikraft/kraftkit/pull/339).

Similar to the top-level `unikraft` and `template` elements (see below), the `runtime` element can be specified using a short-hand syntax or a long-hand syntax for greater control or preference.

1. In short-hand syntax, simply referencing the pre-built unikernel image is possible by declaring:

   ```yaml
   spec: v0.6

   runtime: unikraft.org/nginx:latest
   ```

   In the above example, the `runtime` element refers to an OCI archive for Nginx.
   In a `kraft run` scenario, this is simply pulled and executed verbatim.
   Paired with the ability to customize the `rootfs` element or `volumes` elemen, the `runtime` element becomes more pragmatic:

   ```yaml
   spec: v0.6

   runtime: unikraft.org/nginx:latest

   rootfs: ./
   ```

   Or with a volume, which simply "overwrites" an existing directory already located within Nginx's root filesystem that is distributed as part of the OCI image:

   ```yaml
   spec: v0.6

   runtime: unikraft.org/nginx:latest

   volumes:
   - ./html:/nginx/html
   ```

   In the above snippet, the user customizes only the directory which serves HTML with a path `./html` which is located on their host.

   Note that this usecase is not limited to a single application and applies to the ELF Loader application and customizing the loaded application which is part of a root filesystem:

   ```yaml
   spec: v0.6

   # Default ELF Loader application
   runtime: loaders.unikraft.org/default:latest 

   # Path must contain the Linux ELF binary, e.g. at ./rootfs/helloworld
   rootfs: ./rootfs

   cmd: ["/helloworld"]
   ```

   or a high-level programming language such as python3:

   ```yaml
   spec: v0.6

   runtime: unikraft.org/python3:latest

   rootfs: ./Dockerfile

   cmd: ["/main.py"]
   ```

   In the above snippet, the user has created a `Dockerfile` which contains the necessary root filesystem and included their application at `/main.py`.

1. The long-hand syntax allows specifically setting `source`, `version` and `kconfig` options which are requirements of the runtime:

   ```yaml
   spec: v0.6

   runtime:
     source: unikraft.org/nginx
     version: latest
     kconfig:
       CONFIG_LIB9PFS: 'y'
    ```

    In the above example, the pre-built Nginx unikernel has been requested as the runtime with the explicit option of having the 9P Filesystem enabled.

#### D. Fully realizing the `template` element

There were several issues related to the `template` element, including the fact that it was not properly seeded, or transformed, from the `Kraftfile` into the application structure.
This has now been tested end-to-end and enables:

1. Workflows where a user may wish to reference an existing application repository and make customizations, for example, with the [ELF Loader](https://github.com/unikraft/app-elfloader.git) application, making changes to the core configuration and adding additional targets:

   ```yaml
   spec: v0.6

   template: https://github.com/unikraft/app-elfloader.git

   unikraft:
     version: stable
     kconfig:
       CONFIG_LIBUKLIBPARAM: 'y'
       CONFIG_LIBNOLIBC: 'y'
       CONFIG_LIBNOLIBC_UKDEBUG_ASSERT: 'y'
       CONFIG_LIBPOSIX_EVENT: 'y'
       CONFIG_LIBPOSIX_FUTEX: 'y'
       CONFIG_LIBPOSIX_MMAP: 'y'
       CONFIG_LIBPOSIX_releaseOCESS: 'y'
       CONFIG_LIBPOSIX_releaseOCESS_PIDS: 'y'
       CONFIG_LIBPOSIX_releaseOCESS_MAX_PID: 31
       CONFIG_LIBPOSIX_releaseOCESS_CLONE: 'y'
       CONFIG_LIBPOSIX_SOCKET: 'y'
       CONFIG_LIBPOSIX_SYSINFO: 'y'
       CONFIG_LIBPOSIX_TIME: 'y'
       CONFIG_LIBPOSIX_USER: 'y'
       CONFIG_LIBUKSIGNAL: 'y'
       CONFIG_LIBSYSCALL_SHIM: 'y'
       CONFIG_LIBVFSCORE_AUTOMOUNT_ROOTFS: 'y'
       CONFIG_LIBVFSCORE_ROOTFS_INITRD: 'y'
       CONFIG_LIBVFSCORE_ROOTFS: "initrd"
       CONFIG_APPELFLOADER_VFSEXEC_EXECBIT: 'n'

   targets:
   - plat: qemu
     arch: x86_64
     kconfig:
       CONFIG_VIRTIO_BUS: 'n'
   - plat: firecracker
     arch: x86_64
   ```

1. Similar to other component elements (e.g. `unikraft` and `libraries`), the `template` element can be expressed in a longer format:

   ```yaml
   spec: v0.6

   template:
     source: https://github.com/unikraft/app-elfloader.git
     version: stable
   ```

### New workflow scenarios

The following workflow scenarios were used during testing.

#### A. Using a pre-built unikernel and customizing the root filesystem

Customizing the whole root filesystem is now possible by supplying either:

1. A path representing a prebuilt CPIO archive file:

   ```yaml
   spec: v0.6

   runtime: unikraft.org/nginx:latest

   rootfs: ./initramfs.cpio
   ```

1. A directory which will be dynamically serialized into a CPIO archive:

   ```yaml
   spec: v0.6

   runtime: unikraft.org/nginx:latest

   rootfs: ./rootfs/
   ```

1. Or, a `Dockerfile` which will be built via BuildKit and then serialized into a new CPIO archive:

   ```yaml
   spec: v0.6

   runtime: unikraft.org/nginx:latest

   rootfs: ./Dockerfile
   ```

   To use BuildKit, set the address within the new `buildkit_host` user setting, the new environmental variable `KRAFTKIT_BUILDKIT_HOST` or the command-line flag `--buildkit-host`.
   This defaults to `unix:///run/buildkit/buildkitd.sock`.


#### B. Using a pre-built unikernel and mounting a path within the root filesystem

1. Specifying via short-hand syntax a map between a directory on the host and a path within the instance:

   ```yaml
   spec: v0.6

   runtime: unikraft.org/nginx:latest

   volumes:
   - ./src:/nginx/html
   ```

1. Using a more verbose (long-hand) syntax and mapping between the mount on the host and a path within the instance:

   ```yaml
   spec: v0.6

   runtime: unikraft.org/nginx:latest

   volumes:
   - source: ./src
     destination: /nginx/html
   ```


## OCI Indexes and Multi-Platform Images

<Warning>
This contains breaking changes to the OCI package manager.
As a result, when you upgrade be sure to re-package and re-push your OCI images.
</Warning>

This large refactor reworks the OCI package manager to assume the use of the OCI image specification's index such that we can represent multiple manifests within a single canonical referencable name.
This means that we can build multiple unikernels with the same name.
This makes sense for multi-target projects which build the same application but target different hardware/platform vendors.

The structure of the index can be found [here](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/main/image-index.md) and in this implementation we itemized each manifest in the index in the same way.
When we use the `Catalog` method now, we are able to query a remote registry based on the selected OS (platform) and architecture as well as any embedded KConfig options (if they are embedded).

When packaging multiple targets of a single application, the resulting package will be listed for all unique targets:

```console
kraft pkg ls --apps
```
```
TYPE  NAME        VERSION  FORMAT  DIGEST   PLAT
app   helloworld  latest   oci     e8be0a9  qemu/x86_64
app   helloworld  latest   oci     a6802f4  qemu/arm64
```

Use cases include selecting appropriately based on the host's architecture as well as feature selection via embedded KConfig options.

Notable additional improvements which are incorporated in this pull request include:

- Better offline mode in each package manager: all internal package managers were optimized to reduce instantiation time which makes a noticeable impact when using `kraft` in offline mode;
- Better outputs in `kraft pkg ls` which now has dynamic column data information;
- Better prompts in `kraft pkg` for selecting and packaging individual targets from an application project;
- `kraft pkg prune` has been renamed to `kraft pkg rm` and now works for all underlying implementations (per-manifest type for libraries and components, and directory and containerd for OCI packages);
- Better handling of insecure authenticated OCI registries; and,
- Natively selecting the host platform and architecture in `kraft pkg pull` when no additional flags are provided.


## A New Pre-built Community Image Catalog

Following the ability to package multiple platform/architecture combinations now
using a single canonical OCI image reference, and to help ease using pre-built
unikernel applications, we're excited to release a new community catalog of
pre-built unikernel images, ready to use.

GitHub](https://github.com/unikraft/catalog).

```console
kraft pkg ls --apps --update
```

## Dockerfile root filesystem creation via BuildKit

This release includes the ability to construct root filesystems from new and existing `Dockerfile` definitions.
This is made possible by rearchitecting [the `initrd` package](https://pkg.go.dev/kraftkit.sh@v0.7.0/initrd) to support different input types.
When using a root filesystem which is ultimately serialized into a CPIO archive (including previously built CPIO archives which simply represent a no-op), these can be dynamically built.

Using `Dockerfile` via BuildKit to build root filesystems offers several advantages in terms of efficiency, portability, and ease of management which were considered before implementation:

1. **Reproducibility**
   - A `Dockerfile` enables you to specify the exact steps needed to build your filesystem, making the build process reproducible.
   - BuildKit's caching mechanisms enhance build efficiency by reusing layers when the dependencies and source code haven't changed, which speeds up the build process.

1. **Portability**
   - BuildKit supports multi-platform builds, enabling you to create filesystems for different architectures without changing the `Dockerfile`.

1. **Ease of Use**
   - A `Dockerfile` provides a user-friendly, human-readable format for defining the build steps, making it accessible to developers with varying levels of expertise.
   - Leveraging the extensive Docker ecosystem and allowing the re-usse of many existing filesystems which speed up using unikernels 

To get started building `Dockerfile`s as part of your existing project, check out the updated documentation on [filesystem support in KraftKIt](/docs/cli/filesystem#building-and-packaging-a-static-initram-root-filesystem).
